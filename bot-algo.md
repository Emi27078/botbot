bot uses a brute force appraoch to examines the tiles in hand at every rotation at every legal position next to the existig tiles then for every legal placemet it gives it a priority score focused mainly on extending/completing already claimed structures and the tile with the highest priority is placed. The meeple logic prioritises placing meeples on structures mainly monnastaries then cities then roads and places the meeple on the first valid unclaimed incomplete structure it finds in priority order.
